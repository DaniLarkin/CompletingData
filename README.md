#  Machine Learning Project - Data Completion  

##  Description  

This project uses **Machine Learning** to automatically fill in missing values in a spreadsheet containing information about YouTube channels.  

The spreadsheet has the following columns:  
- **Channel**  
- **Subscribers** 
- **Views**   

If any of the fields are missing (`NaN` values), the model can estimate and complete the data based on patterns identified from the existing dataset.  

##  Objective  

The goal is to demonstrate how **data science** and **machine learning** techniques can be applied to handle missing values in datasets, ensuring greater consistency and quality for further analysis.
